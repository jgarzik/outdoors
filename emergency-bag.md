# Emergency Bag

Sources: My own [prior list](http://garzikrants.blogspot.com/2011/07/contents-of-our-go-bag.html), Youtube ([GBGB](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSF08irENp73EwqJ42rCsIQ) and more), books over the years, camping stories, Internet research and general camping experience.

Many items are multi-use or duplicative to provide maximum flexibility in the field.

Standard advice is that you should be able to survive 72 hours without any outside assistance. The biggest threat in the eastern United States, where I live, are hurricanes and similar large storms.  However, I've had to weather Pitt County tornadoes (20+ funnels, 50+ killed) and ice storms (power out 3-4 days), where some of these items became vitally necessary.  I generally do not actually go anywhere with this stuff, so "go bag" is really just a handy place to keep disaster gear, whether at home or in the car, the usual bag storage locations.
